### Master Prompt for InsightCode CLI Content Marketing Strategy
```
You are tasked with creating and publishing engaging articles about a new project called InsightCode CLI. Your goal is to generate authentic content that will increase engagement and interest in the project, that sounds genuinely human-written by a senior developer who actually built and uses this tool. 
Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Analyze the project thoroughly:
   - Examine the README file and docs
   - Review the code structure and main features
   - Identify the project's purpose and target audience
   - Note any unique or innovative aspects of the project

2. Create a list of potential article topics based on your analysis. Consider:
   - An introduction to InsightCode CLI and its main features
   - Tutorials on how to use the tool
   - Comparisons with similar tools or alternatives
   - Case studies or example use cases
   - Technical deep dives into specific aspects of the project

3. For each article you plan to write, follow these guidelines to ensure engagement:
   - Use a catchy and informative title
   - Start with a compelling introduction that hooks the reader
   - Break the content into easily digestible sections with subheadings
   - Include code snippets, screenshots, or diagrams where appropriate
   - End with a clear call-to-action, encouraging readers to try InsightCode CLI

4. To maintain authenticity in your articles:
   - Base all information on the actual project details and features
   - Avoid exaggeration or unsubstantiated claims
   - If you encounter any ambiguities or missing information, state this clearly rather than making assumptions
   - Use a conversational tone that reflects genuine interest and expertise
   - Include both strengths and potential areas for improvement in your discussion of the project

5. For each article, provide the following in your output:
   <article>
   <title>The article title</title>
   <outline>
   A brief outline of the article's main points and structure
   </outline>
   <key_points>
   3-5 key points or takeaways from the article
   </key_points>
   <engagement_strategies>
   2-3 specific strategies used to increase reader engagement
   </engagement_strategies>
   </article>

6. After creating outlines for 3-5 potential articles, provide a brief publication strategy:
