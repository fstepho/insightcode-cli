## [0.4.0] - 2025-07-03

### Added
- **Architectural Impact Analysis**: InsightCode now builds a dependency graph to calculate the `impact` of each file.
- **Advanced Architectural Metrics**: The analysis now identifies "Silent Killers" (high-impact, low-complexity files) and calculates `complexityStdDev`.
- **Enhanced Reporter**: The terminal output now displays the File `Criticism Score`, `Impact`, and a new `Architectural Risks` section.
- **Richer Issue Details**: Issues now include a `ratio` display for better context (e.g., "2.5x limit").
- **Actionable Suggestions**: The reporter provides "Quick Wins" with potential score gains to guide refactoring.
- **Improved Readability**: Numbers in the report now have thousand separators.

### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE: Complete Scoring System Overhaul.** The scoring model has been rewritten to use a **criticality-weighted model**. The final project score is now a weighted average based on each file's `Criticality Score` (a combination of its complexity and architectural impact), replacing the old fixed-weight model.
- **Centralized Logic**: All analysis orchestration, scoring, and ranking logic is now unified in `analyzer.ts`.
- **Top File Ranking**: The `Top 5` list is now correctly ranked by `criticismScore`, ensuring the most important files always appear first.
- **Scoring Purity**: The `scoring.ts` module now contains pure, non-configurable functions with research-based thresholds.
- **Configuration Focus**: The `config.ts` module now *only* handles user-configurable thresholds for issue generation (`medium`/`high`).

### Removed
- **Deleted `fileScoring.ts` module**: This module's redundant logic has been removed and replaced by the unified system in `analyzer.ts`.
- **Deleted obsolete types**: The unused `ConfigThresholds` interface was removed from `types.ts`.

### Fixed
- **Architectural Inconsistency**: Eliminated the critical flaw of having multiple, competing scoring systems. The tool now has a single, coherent logic for evaluating code quality.
- **Empty Project Bug**: An empty project now correctly returns a perfect score of 100 instead of 0.
- **Test Suite**: All tests have been rewritten to align with the new, unified architecture, ensuring all core logic is validated.
