# InsightCode Scoring Thresholds: Justification - v0.6.0

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive justification for the scoring thresholds and methodology used in InsightCode v0.6.0. Our approach implements **industry best practices** following the **Rules of the Art**: Linear → Quadratic → Exponential progression, validated against empirical data from 9 popular open-source projects representing over 670,000 lines of production code.

## Methodology Overview - v0.6.0

InsightCode v0.6.0 implements a **research-based weighted scoring model** that respects fundamental software engineering principles:

### 🏛️ **Foundational Principles**
1. **Pareto Principle (80/20)**: 20% of code causes 80% of problems - extreme complexity receives extreme penalties
2. **ISO/IEC 25010 Maintainability**: Complexity violations clearly identified without masking
3. **Fowler Technical Debt**: Debt must be visible and quantifiable - no logarithmic scaling
4. **McCabe Research**: Complexity ≤10 threshold for maintainable code

### 📊 **Scoring Methodology**
- **Complexity Weight**: 45% (McCabe research - primary defect predictor)
- **Maintainability Weight**: 30% (Martin Clean Code - development velocity impact)  
- **Duplication Weight**: 25% (Fowler Refactoring - technical debt indicator)

### 🚫 **Anti-Patterns Eliminated**
- **No artificial caps**: Removed all soft-caps that masked extreme complexity
- **No logarithmic scaling**: Raw values used to prevent masking of outliers
- **No debt masking**: Progressive penalties without upper limits

## 1. Cyclomatic Complexity Thresholds

### Justification for McCabe Complexity Boundaries

#### Academic Foundation
The cyclomatic complexity metric was introduced by Thomas McCabe in 1976 and remains the most widely validated complexity measure in software engineering.

**Key Research Findings:**
- **≤ 10 (Excellent)**: McCabe's original recommendation for maximum function complexity [McCabe, 1976].
- **10-15 (Good)**: Supported by empirical studies showing manageable testing overhead [Watson & McCabe, 1996].
- **15-20 (Acceptable)**: Industry threshold where defect probability begins increasing significantly [Basili et al., 1996].
- **20-30 (Poor)**: Critical threshold where maintainability degrades rapidly [Oman & Hagemeister, 1992].
- **30+ (Critical)**: Strong correlation with defect density and maintenance costs [Subramanyam & Krishnan, 2003].

#### Empirical Validation from Our Dataset

**Analysis of 9 Popular Projects (674k+ LOC, Production Code):**
```

Avg Complexity | Projects | Avg Grade
≤ 10           | 3        | B
10-30          | 3        | D-F
30+            | 3        | F

```

#### Industry Validation
- **Google Style Guide**: Recommends ≤ 10 complexity.
- **Microsoft**: Uses 15 as a warning threshold in Visual Studio.
- **SonarQube**: Default thresholds align with our boundaries.

### v0.6.0 Rules of the Art Implementation

**Methodology**: Linear → Quadratic → Exponential progression following industry best practices

#### **Phase 1: Excellent (≤10)**
- **Score**: 100 points
- **Rationale**: McCabe's original threshold for maintainable code
- **Research**: Strong empirical validation across 40+ years of studies

#### **Phase 2: Linear Degradation (10-20)**  
- **Score**: 100 → 70 points (3 points penalty per unit)
- **Rationale**: Industry standard for acceptable complexity increase
- **Research**: Defect probability remains manageable in this range

#### **Phase 3: Quadratic Penalty (20-50)**
- **Score**: 70 → 30 points (quadratic progression)  
- **Rationale**: Reflects exponentially growing maintenance burden
- **Research**: Strong correlation with maintainability degradation

#### **Phase 4: Exponential Penalty (>50)**
- **Score**: 30 → 0 points (exponential decay)
- **Rationale**: Extreme complexity = extreme penalties (Pareto principle)
- **Research**: Critical threshold where systems become unmaintainable

#### **Real-World Validation**
| Complexity Range | TypeScript Examples | Score | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| ≤10 | Simple functions | 100 | Excellent maintainability |
| 10-20 | Moderate functions | 100-70 | Good maintainability |  
| 20-50 | Complex functions | 70-30 | Degrading maintainability |
| 50-100 | Very complex | 30-0 | Poor maintainability |
| 1000+ | createTypeChecker(979) | 0 | **Catastrophic** |
| 16000+ | createTypeChecker(16081) | 0 | **Unmaintainable** |

## 2. Code Duplication Thresholds

### Academic Research on Code Duplication

#### Foundational Studies
Code duplication research has consistently shown strong correlations between duplication levels and maintenance costs [Kapser & Godfrey, 2008].

**Key Research Findings:**
- **≤ 3% (Excellent)**: Industry leaders like Google maintain ~2-3% duplication [Fowler, 2019].
- **3-8% (Good)**: Acceptable level found in well-maintained enterprise systems [Kim et al., 2005].
- **8-15% (Acceptable)**: Pragmatic threshold balancing effort vs. benefit [Juergens et al., 2009].
- **15-30% (Poor)**: Significantly increased maintenance overhead [Roy & Cordy, 2007].
- **30%+ (Critical)**: Strong predictor of system decay [Lague et al., 1997].

#### v0.6.0 Detection Algorithm
Our **pragmatic approach** uses 8-line blocks with literal pattern matching, focusing on actionable copy-paste duplication:

**Key Features:**
- **8-line sliding window** (enhanced from 3-line for meaningful patterns)
- **MD5 hashing** of normalized blocks for exact matching
- **Cross-file detection only** (avoids intra-file false positives)
- **Semantic normalization** (variables, strings, numbers) to catch real duplication

**Philosophy:** Avoids false positives in test suites while catching actionable duplication patterns.

### v0.6.0 Threshold Justification (Exponential Decay Model)

**Methodology:** Exponential decay beyond 15% threshold - no caps for extreme cases

| Threshold | Score | v0.6.0 Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **≤ 15%** | 100 pts | **Excellent**: Aligned with industry standards, pragmatic threshold |
| **15-30%** | 100→70 pts | **Degrading**: Exponential decay reflects maintenance burden |
| **30-50%** | 70→30 pts | **Poor**: Strong correlation with system decay |
| **>50%** | 30→0 pts | **Critical**: Extreme duplication = extreme penalties (Pareto) |

**Real-World Validation:**
- **TypeScript Compiler**: 0% detected (excellent literal hygiene)
- **Vue Framework**: 0% detected (good modularization)  
- **Industry Average**: 0-15% for well-maintained codebases

## 3. Maintainability Thresholds

### File Size Research and Industry Standards

#### Academic Foundation
Research on optimal file sizes is linked to cognitive load theory.
- **Human Short-term Memory**: 7±2 items (Miller's Law) translates to ~200 LOC chunks [Miller, 1956].
- **Code Comprehension**: Optimal file size for understanding is ~200-300 lines [Shaft & Vessey, 2006].

#### Industry Standards
- **Google**: 200-300 lines per file recommendation.
- **Microsoft**: 300-400 lines for C# files.

### Function Count Research
- **≤ 10 functions/file**: Adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle [Martin, 2003].
- **10-15 functions/file**: Represents acceptable cohesion levels [Chidamber & Kemerer, 1994].

### Threshold Justification

#### File Size Score
| Threshold | Score | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **≤ 200** | 100 pts | Optimal: Aligns with cognitive load research. |
| **≤ 300** | 85 pts | Good: Aligns with Google/Microsoft guidelines. |
| **≤ 500** | 50 pts | Large: Approaching expert programmer session limit. |
| **> 750** | Variable | Critical: Strong correlation with defect injection. |

#### Function Count Score
| Threshold | Score | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **≤ 10** | 100 pts | Well-focused: Adheres to Single Responsibility Principle. |
| **≤ 15** | 85 pts | Good: Acceptable cohesion. |
| **≤ 20** | 70 pts | Acceptable: Approaching maintainability threshold. |
| **> 30** | Variable | Critical: Likely a "God Class" anti-pattern. |
