## Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Academic Best Practices Implementation

### Task: Implement Academic Best Practices for Metric Aggregation

**Completed on: 2025-07-03**

#### ‚úÖ Completed Items:
- [x] Implemented weighted average calculation for project-level scores
- [x] Changed from calculating scores on project averages to weighted averages of file scores
- [x] Used file size (LOC) as weighting factor (industry standard)
- [x] Established single source of truth for 40/30/30 philosophy in scoring.ts
- [x] Fixed empty file list edge case (returns perfect score of 100)
- [x] Verified mathematical consistency with all 31 tests passing
- [x] Validated real-world functionality with JSON output showing detailed score breakdown

#### Key Technical Achievements:
- **Mathematical Consistency**: Project scores now properly aggregate file-level scores using weighted averages
- **Academic Standards**: Follows research-based best practices for metric aggregation
- **Single Source of Truth**: All scoring calculations use shared functions from `scoring.ts`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing API while improving internal calculations

#### Session Notes:
- **Before**: Project scores calculated from project averages (complexity: 55, duplication: 57, maintainability: 71, overall: 61)
- **After**: Project scores calculated as weighted averages of file scores (same results, but mathematically correct)
- **Impact**: No user-visible changes, but internal calculations now follow academic best practices

#### Architecture Changes:
1. **analyzer.ts**: Completely refactored to use weighted averages of file scores
2. **scoring.ts**: Centralized all scoring logic with 40/30/30 weighting
3. **fileScoring.ts**: Unified file scoring to use same functions as project scoring
4. **types.ts**: Enriched FileMetrics with scoring information

#### Current Project Metrics:
- **Total Files**: 15 (core project, excluding benchmarks)
- **Total Lines**: 2,802 lines
- **Source Files**: 7 TypeScript files, 1,035 lines
- **Test Files**: 31 tests across 3 test files
- **Current Score**: D (61/100)
- **Grade Distribution**: complexity: 55, duplication: 57, maintainability: 71
- **Top Issues**: 
  - High complexity in parser.ts (61), reporter.ts (44), scoring.ts (26)
  - Medium duplication in benchmark scripts
  - File size issues in validation script

## Next Task: üîÑ Documentation Update Complete

### Task: Update All Project Documentation

**Status: IN PROGRESS**

#### Objectives:
- [ ] Update all documentation to reflect current state
- [ ] Ensure consistency across all documentation files
- [ ] Follow DOC_MAINTENANCE_CHECKLIST.md systematically

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All metrics updated to current values
- [ ] Recent architectural decisions documented
- [ ] Consistency verified across all documents
- [ ] Ready for next development session

#### Files to Update:
1. **CURRENT_TASK.md** - ‚úÖ This file
2. **AI_CONTEXT.md** - üìù Update with current metrics
3. **DECISIONS.md** - üìù Add recent architectural decisions
4. **CLAUDE.md** - üìù Update line counts and metrics
5. **CHANGELOG.md** - üìù Add unreleased changes
6. **README.md** - üìù Verify accuracy
