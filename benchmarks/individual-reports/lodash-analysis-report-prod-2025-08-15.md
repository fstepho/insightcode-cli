## Quality Summary

### Grade: 🔴 **D**

With a grade of **D**, **lodash** is a **requiring immediate attention** project. Our analysis identifies the **`fp`** module as the primary technical debt concentration. Key concerns include `fp/_baseConvert.js` (health score: 0%) and `fp/_mapping.js` (health score: 79%). The most prevalent issues are **poorly named** (44% of all issues) followed by **god functions**. 

**🎯 Strategic recommendation:** Focus Phase 1 efforts on stabilizing the `fp` module.

### 📊 Scoring Methodology

InsightCode combines **research-based thresholds** with **criticality-weighted aggregation**, following the **Pareto principle**.

#### 🔧 Overall Score Calculation
InsightCode uses a **two-step weighted aggregation** process:

**Step 1:** Each metric is weighted by architectural criticality:
```
Weighted_Complexity = Σ(File_Complexity × CriticismScore) / Σ(CriticismScore)
Weighted_Maintainability = Σ(File_Maintainability × CriticismScore) / Σ(CriticismScore)
Weighted_Duplication = Σ(File_Duplication × CriticismScore) / Σ(CriticismScore)
Weighted_Reliability = Σ(File_Reliability × CriticismScore) / Σ(CriticismScore)
```

**Step 2:** Final score combines weighted metrics:
```
Overall Score = (Weighted_Complexity × 35%) + (Weighted_Maintainability × 25%) + (Weighted_Duplication × 20%) + (Weighted_Reliability × 20%)
```

#### 🧮 Metric Configuration
| Metric | Final Weight | Thresholds & Research Basis |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| **Complexity** | 35% | McCabe (1976): ≤10 = low, ≤15 = medium, ≤20 = high, ≤50 = very high, >50 = extreme |
| **Maintainability** | 25% | Clean Code principles: ≤200 LOC/file preferred, progressive penalties |
| **Duplication** | 20% | Legacy threshold: ≤15% considered excellent for brownfield projects |
| **Reliability** | 20% | Based on detected issues: deep nesting, long functions, complex conditions |

#### 🧭 Architectural Criticality Formula
Each file’s weight is computed as:
```
CriticismScore = (Dependencies × 2.0) + (WeightedIssues × 0.5) + 1
```
- **Dependencies:** incoming + outgoing + cycle penalty (if any)
- **WeightedIssues:** critical×4 + high×3 + medium×2 + low×1
- **Note:** Complexity excluded to avoid double-counting (already weighted at 45%)
- **Base +1** avoids zero weighting

#### 🎓 Grade Scale
**A** (90-100) • **B** (80-89) • **C** (70-79) • **D** (60-69) • **F** (<60)

## File Health Distribution

| Health Status | Count | Percentage |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| 🟢 Excellent (A: 90-100) | 15 | 75% |
| 🟢 Very Good (B: 80-89) | 1 | 5% |
| 🟡 Good (C: 70-79) | 1 | 5% |
| 🟠 Moderate (D: 60-69) | 0 | 0% |
| 🔴 Poor (F: <60) | 3 | 15% |

## Critical Files Requiring Attention

| File | Health | Criticism | Primary Concern |

## 🔬 Technical Notes

### Duplication Detection
- **Algorithm:** Enhanced 8-line literal pattern matching with 20+ token minimum, cross-file exact matches only
- **Focus:** Copy-paste duplication using MD5 hashing of normalized blocks (not structural similarity)
- **Philosophy:** Pragmatic approach using regex normalization - avoids false positives while catching actionable duplication
- **Results:** Typically 0-15% duplication vs ~70% with structural detection tools, filtering imports/trivial declarations

### Complexity Calculation
- **Method:** McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity (1976) + Industry Best Practices
- **Scoring:** Linear (≤10→20) → Quadratic (20→50) → Exponential (>50) - Rules of the Art
- **Research Base:** Internal methodology inspired by Pareto Principle - extreme values dominate

### Health Score Formula
- **Base:** 100 points minus penalties
- **Penalties:** Progressive (linear then exponential) - NO LOGARITHMIC MASKING
- **Caps:** NO CAPS - extreme values receive extreme penalties (following Pareto principle)
- **Purpose:** Identify real problems following Pareto principle (80/20)
