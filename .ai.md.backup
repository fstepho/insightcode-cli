## 📋 Project Context
## 🎯 Mission
Solo dev with side project, 2-4h/day max, goal 200 active users in 6 months.
Create a TypeScript quality analyzer that works 100% locally, never sending data to the cloud.

**Value proposition:** "TypeScript Quality Score in 30 Seconds - Zero Config, 100% Local"

## 👤 Personal Context
- **Technical expertise**: Senior Full-Stack (Java, TypeScript, Angular, Docker)
- **Constraints**: 
  - No customer support (automate everything)
  - Maintenance < 1h/week
  - Side project = absolute simplicity
- **Budget**: €2k total (infrastructure + eventual marketing)
- **Help**: AI as main co-developer
