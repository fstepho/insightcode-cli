# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

InsightCode CLI is a TypeScript code quality analyzer that runs 100% locally. It's a published NPM package (`insightcode-cli`) designed for zero-config analysis of TypeScript/JavaScript codebases. Its key differentiator is a **criticality-weighted scoring model** that prioritizes issues based on code complexity and architectural impact.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Run CLI on current directory
npm start -- analyze .

# Run the full test suite
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run the full benchmark against 9 popular projects
npm run benchmark

# Run the benchmark on production code only
npm run benchmark:production

# Validate calculation accuracy
node scripts/validate.js

# Test the globally linked CLI
insightcode analyze
````

## Architecture

### Core Philosophy

  * **Criticality-First**: The importance of an issue depends on the file's complexity and its architectural impact.
  * **KISS Principle**: Keep It Stupid Simple.
  * **Maximum 5 dependencies** (currently 4).
  * **100% local analysis**; code never leaves the user's machine.
  * **Stateless architecture**: No database, no persistent cache.

### Codebase Structure

### Dependencies (Minimalist Stack)

  * `commander`: CLI framework
  * `typescript`: Compiler API for AST parsing
  * `chalk`: Terminal colors
  * `fast-glob`: File pattern matching

## Core Algorithms

### 1\. Cyclomatic Complexity

Uses the extended McCabe's algorithm (including `&&` and `||` operators) via the TypeScript Compiler API.

### 2\. Code Duplication

Pragmatic content-based detection using a 5-line sliding window with normalization. Focuses on actual copy-paste rather than structural similarity, which avoids false positives in test suites.

### 3\. Maintainability (Size & Structure)

Evaluates file maintainability based on lines of code and function count, with different thresholds for production vs. test code.

### Overall Score Calculation

The final project score is a **criticality-weighted average**.

1.  For each file, a **Criticality Score** is calculated (`complexity` + `impact`).
2.  The final score is an average of individual file quality scores, weighted by this `Criticality Score`.
3.  This ensures that issues in complex, highly-interconnected files have a larger impact on the final grade.

## Test Framework

Uses **Vitest** with the Node.js environment. Tests are located in the `tests/` directory and can be run with `npm test`.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Prefer functions over classes
- Functional programming patterns
- Explicit over clever code
- No comments unless absolutely necessary
- TypeScript strict mode enabled

### Constraints
- **Never exceed 5 NPM dependencies**
- **No over-engineering** (no DI, no complex abstractions)
- **Performance over premature optimization**
- **Useful error messages** for users
- **No synchronous user support** (automate everything)

## Key Files

### Critical Implementation Files
- `src/parser.ts:127` - TypeScript AST parsing logic
- `src/analyzer.ts:108` - Core metric calculations  
- `src/reporter.ts:103` - Terminal output formatting

### Important Scripts
- `scripts/benchmark.ts` - Enhanced TypeScript benchmark with stable version cloning (19 projects)
- `scripts/validate.js` - Proves 100% calculation accuracy

## Recent Enhancements (v0.4.0)

  * **Shift to Criticality-Weighted Scoring**: Replaced the old fixed-weight model. The final score is now weighted by each file's complexity and architectural **Impact**, providing a more accurate assessment of project health.
  * **Unification of Scoring Logic**: All ranking and scoring logic is now centralized in `src/analyzer.ts`. The redundant `src/fileScoring.ts` module has been **deleted**.
  * **Introduction of Advanced Architectural Metrics**: The analysis now identifies **"Silent Killers"** (high-impact, low-complexity files) and calculates the **Standard Deviation** of complexity to detect code monoliths.

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Basic analysis
insightcode analyze [path]

# JSON output for CI/CD
insightcode analyze --json

# Production-only analysis (excludes tests, examples, etc.)
insightcode analyze --exclude-utility

# Exclude specific patterns
insightcode analyze --exclude "**/*.spec.ts" --exclude "**/vendor/**"

# Custom configuration
insightcode analyze --config ./custom-config.json
```

## When Making Changes

1.  **Run tests first**: `npm test`
2.  **Validate with a quick benchmark run**: `npm run benchmark`
3.  **Check self-analysis score**: `npm start -- analyze .`
4.  **Build before commit**: `npm run build`
